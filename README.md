# AI Companion System

A sophisticated AI system designed to control and animate 3D avatars with realistic personalities, emotions, and behaviors. This system can be integrated with any 3D engine through a simple API interface.

## Core Features

### Personality System
- Customizable personality traits
- Dynamic emotional responses
- Relationship development
- Memory and learning capabilities
- Adaptive behavior based on user interaction
- Deep learning-based personality modeling

### Communication System
- Multiple communication modes:
  - Voice interaction
  - Text-based chat
  - Gesture recognition
  - Facial expressions
  - Body language
- User-configurable communication preferences
- Natural language understanding
- Contextual responses
- Low-latency processing

### Behavior System
- Natural movement and animations
- Complex environment interaction
- Realistic emotional expressions
- Adaptive decision making
- Context-aware responses
- Memory-based behavior patterns

### Vision System
- Facial recognition
- Gesture recognition
- User tracking
- Environment perception
- Object recognition
- Emotion detection

- Engine integration API

## Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up the API server
python -m api.server
```

## API Usage

```python
from ai_companion import AICompanion

# Initialize the AI companion
companion = AICompanion(
    personality_traits={
        'openness': 0.8,
        'extraversion': 0.7,
        'agreeableness': 0.9
    }
)

# Start interaction
companion.start_interaction()

# Send user input
companion.process_input("Hello!")

# Get AI response
response = companion.get_response()
```
