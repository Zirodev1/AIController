- Deep learning-based personality modeling

### Communication System
- Multiple communication modes:
  - Voice interaction
  - Text-based chat
  - Gesture recognition
  - Facial expressions
  - Body language
- User-configurable communication preferences
- Natural language understanding
- Contextual responses
- Low-latency processing

### Behavior System
- Natural movement and animations
- Complex environment interaction
- Realistic emotional expressions
- Adaptive decision making
- Context-aware responses
- Memory-based behavior patterns

### Vision System
- Facial recognition
- Gesture recognition

- Scheduled content updates and announcements
- Command-based posting system
- Multi-platform support (Twitter, OnlyFans, etc.)
- Platform-specific content validation
- Automated engagement and responses
- Content scheduling and management

### Image Generation System
- Selfie generation in different poses and expressions

## Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up the API server
python -m api.server
```

## API Usage

```python
from ai_companion import AICompanion

# Initialize the AI companion
companion = AICompanion(
    personality_traits={
        'openness': 0.8,
        'extraversion': 0.7,
        'agreeableness': 0.9
    }
)

# Start interaction
companion.start_interaction()

# Send user input
companion.process_input("Hello!")

# Get AI response
response = companion.get_response()

# Social media commands
companion.process_command("Take a selfie in your garden!")
companion.process_command("Share your current mood with your followers!")

# Schedule a post
companion.social_media.schedule_post(
    "Good morning everyone! *stretches*",
    time="09:00",
    frequency="daily"
)
```
